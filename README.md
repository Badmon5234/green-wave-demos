Welcome to the Green Wave Ventures demo! This interactive experience provides a glimpse into the core functionalities of Green Force OS, our AI-powered platform designed to revolutionize climate resilience, with a primary focus on wildfire prevention.

This demo highlights two key components of Green Force OS:

Overview of Green Force OS : This page introduces the overarching vision of Fire Detection Sensor Software. It outlines our mission to integrate AI-powered sensor technology with a sustainable materials marketplace to enable proactive fire prevention and resilient infrastructure development.

Digital Marketplace: Explore our curated digital marketplace where property owners, developers, and municipalities can browse and discover pre-configured Fire Defense Kits and individual fire-resistant building materials. This section demonstrates how users can access sustainable products from our trusted vendor network, facilitating the procurement of materials essential for building future-proof structures.

While this demo provides a foundational view, it represents the initial steps towards a comprehensive system that will integrate real-time sensor data, AI-driven recommendations, and advanced logistics to transform how fire-resilient infrastructure is planned, deployed, and funded.
